# GainChain Backend Documentation

## Overview
The GainChain backend is designed to power a decentralized application that allows developers to create, manage, and improve their projects using AI-driven insights and automated recommendations. This system is modular, following a well-organized architecture for scalability and maintainability.

---

## Backend Structure
The backend consists of the following components:

### 1. **Controllers**
Controllers handle API requests and act as intermediaries between the services and the frontend.

- **`auth_controller.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Manages user authentication via Internet Identity (ICP's identity service).
  - **Status**: Partially coded (authentication logic implemented, session management pending).

- **`recommendation_controller.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Handles recommendation requests, passing input to the neural network and returning insights.
  - **Status**: Fully coded and functional.

- **`project_controller.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Facilitates project management (create, list, delete projects).
  - **Status**: Fully coded and functional.

- **`canvas_controller.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Manages canvas creation and updates for project idea inputs.
  - **Status**: Coded but undergoing testing for stability.

---

### 2. **Services**
Services contain the core business logic of the application.

- **`neural_net_service.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Implements the recommendation engine using a neural network.
  - **Status**: Fully coded and tested.

- **`user_service.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Manages user creation, retrieval, and updates.
  - **Status**: Partially coded (create and list functions implemented; update function pending).

- **`project_service.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Manages CRUD operations for projects.
  - **Status**: Fully coded.

- **`canvas_service.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Handles operations related to the canvas, including adding and updating elements.
  - **Status**: Partially coded (update function under review).

---

### 3. **Models**
Models define the data structures for the system.

- **`user_model.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Defines the `User` structure.
  - **Status**: Fully coded.

- **`project_model.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Defines the `Project` structure.
  - **Status**: Fully coded.

- **`canvas.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Defines the `Canvas` structure for storing project ideas.
  - **Status**: Fully coded.

- **`recommendation.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Defines the structure for recommendations.
  - **Status**: Fully coded.

---

### 4. **Utilities**
Helper functions for backend operations.

- **`canister_utils.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Provides utility functions for stable memory management.
  - **Status**: Fully coded.

- **`utilities.rs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Provides general utilities like ID generation and time formatting.
  - **Status**: Fully coded.

---

## What Has Been Coded
1. **Authentication**: Basic setup for Internet Identity.
2. **Recommendation Engine**: Functional and integrated with the neural network.
3. **Project Management**: Create, list, and delete operations are complete.
4. **Canvas Operations**: Canvas creation and basic updates are implemented.
5. **Utilities**: General utilities are available and tested.

---

## What Is Yet to Be Coded
1. **Authentication Enhancements**:
   - Session management.
   - Multi-factor authentication (if needed).

2. **Canvas Updates**:
   - Advanced editing and versioning capabilities.
   - Integration with AI for on-the-fly project idea enhancements.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error messages for frontend interaction.
   - Graceful handling of invalid input.

4. **Testing**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all modules.
   - Integration tests for end-to-end functionality.

5. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Optimize deployment scripts.
   - Automate versioning.

## User Experience Expectations
1. **Ease of Use**:
   - Users can easily create and manage projects via a user-friendly API.
   - Seamless canvas functionality for brainstorming project ideas.

2. **AI-Assisted Recommendations**:
   - Provides actionable insights based on project data.

3. **Secure Access**:
   - Reliable user authentication and data protection.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
   - Modular architecture to support future features.

---

## Plan at Hand
1. **Refinement**:
   - Stabilize all coded features and fix identified bugs.

2. **Feature Completion**:
   - Implement pending features, especially advanced canvas and authentication functions.

3. **Testing**:
   - Conduct rigorous testing to ensure reliability.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Finalize user and developer documentation.

5. **Demo Preparation**:
   - Create a short demo showcasing key features like AI recommendations, project creation, and canvas management.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy on ICP with optimized settings.
